# Data Extraction from .txt Files

This repository contains a Python script designed to extract data from a space-delimited `.txt` file and save the results in a `.ras` file. The script specifically extracts all columns from the input file and includes the corresponding column names in the output file.

## Features
- Extracts all columns from a space-delimited `.txt` file.
- Saves the extracted data into a `.ras` file with appropriate column headers.
- Easy to use with Google Colab.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Google Colab (for easy execution)

2. **Upload your `.txt` file** when prompted.

3. The script will process the file and create a `.ras` file containing the extracted data.

4. **Download the resulting `.ras` file** from the output.
